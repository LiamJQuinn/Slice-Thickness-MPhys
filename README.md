Video Thickness Analysis Tool
Description
This tool is designed to analyze a video file to measure the thickness of a sample at various depths. It provides a set of features to handle the selection of the video file, setting up the analysis parameters, and saving the results for further investigation.

Features
Video File Selection: Allows users to select the video file for analysis.
Save Location Selection: Users can choose where to save the output results.
User Input Prompts: Gather necessary parameters such as the maximum depth covered by the video, the frame interval for analysis, the desired interval for measurements, options for multiple line measurements, and toggling visualizations.
Exclusion Zone Selection: Users can define an area at the top of the frame to ignore during analysis.
Video Analysis: Processes the video frame by frame, extracting vertical lines and calculating the thickness of the sample.
Results Saving: The measurements are saved in a CSV file.
Results Plotting: Generates a plot of thickness versus depth.
Log File Generation: Creates a log file with the user's input parameters and the time taken for video analysis.
Usage
Run the Program: Start the main program.
Input Parameters: Enter the required parameters following the on-screen prompts.
File Selection: Choose the video file and save location as prompted by the dialogs.
Exclusion Zone: Optionally set the exclusion zone depth if necessary.
Analysis: Wait while the program analyzes the video and generates results.
Results: Check the specified save location for the CSV file and log file.
Plot: Review the displayed plot of thickness vs. depth.
Data Plotter (PLOTTER.py)
Description
This separate utility, PLOTTER.py, reads the results of the thickness measurements from a CSV file and provides visual representations of the data. It displays slice thickness as a function of depth and applies smoothing filters to the results.

Features
Data Visualization: Generates plots for slice thickness versus depth, including raw and smoothed data.
Targeted Data Points: Highlights slice thickness values at specific depth intervals.
Bar Plot: Creates a bar plot grouping slice thickness by depth bins of 100 mm.
Resolution Integral Calculation: Computes a resolution integral using the trapezoidal rule as a quantitative measure of the probe's performance.
Depth of Field and Characteristic Resolution: Estimates the depth of field and characteristic resolution from the resolution integral.
Probe Comparison Matrix: Outputs a set of metrics for probe comparison including resolution integral, depth of field, characteristic resolution, and extreme slice thickness values.
Usage
Run PLOTTER.py.
Select the CSV file with the results when prompted.
Review the plots generated by the script.
Check the console output for the resolution integral and other calculated metrics.
